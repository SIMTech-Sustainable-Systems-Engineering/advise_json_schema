This includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions from PUB facilities, aligned to PUB’s GreenGov.SG reporting submissions. It also includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions from NEWater and Desalination Design, Build, Own and Operate (DBOO) facilities, and Scope 1 emissions from sludge incineration and discharge of treated used water effluent to sea. These emissions are then divided by total Singapore water demand to give Singapore's Water Emissions Intensity.\nIt is difficult to separate out the Potable water and NEWater emission intensity to two separate emission intensities as PUB operates in a closed-loop water system where the same drop of water will be recycled and used for both potable water and NEWater. Please refer to PUB's website to learn more about PUB’s closed water loop.",
